# Repository Archive Notice

I’m archiving this repository as a memento of my internship at Atlantbh. While the project was never fully completed, I’m proud of the progress made and the skills I developed during this time.

## Description

This project showcases my experience and growth in various technologies while working on a real-world application.

## Key Technologies and Services

- **Firebase Storage:** Utilized for cloud-based storage of files and media.
- **Angular:** Implemented for the front end.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used for data storage.
- **Java:** The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot:** A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications.

## Reason for Archiving

Although I believe the project holds value, the effort required to bring it to a completion state currently outweighs its potential benefits.

Thank you for your interest in my work!
