## Folder Structure Explanation

The folder structure outlined here is designed for scenarios in which a particular feature necessitates nesting. It serves as a container for organizing related sets of features.

### Example:

- **home/**
  - *about*
  - *terms-conditions*
  - *privacy-policy*

The folders within nested features fulfill the same organizational role as those found within a simple feature folder.

**Simple Feature Folder Reference:**

- **components**: Contains local components created to represent a specific section of a page.
- **feature**: Groups together local and global components to form a visual representation of a page.
- **services**: Houses services related to the feature, such as data fetching.


**This structure can be expanded as needed to accommodate specific features.**
